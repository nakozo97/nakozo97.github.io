  <p>Hello Everyone! My name is Alex Reyes and I am currently studying Data Analytics at USC. 
    I have previous work experience in Operations and Supply Chain Management. I like to work out and eat. In fact, I work out to eat! </p>
  <p>This year has been a very difficult tough year for me personally but I have learned new things. I have also made new friends this year that wouldn't have happened without the Rona.</p>
